⛔ DEPRECATED. This example demonstrated how to use this textbox for grid filtering. Starting with v14.2, GridView provides the built-in Search Panel functionality with the capability to locate it outside grid boundaries. Refer to the <a href="http://docs.devexpress.devx/AspNet/17651/components/grid-view/concepts/filter-data/search-panel">Search Panel</a> topic for details.

You can try this functionality in the following online demo:
